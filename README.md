# ROS2-based SLAM for differential drive robot using Lidar and Camera.
This project implements simulitanuous localization and mapping of a differential robot (three-wheeled robot) using ROS humble and Gazebo classic.
## The custom gazebo environment and the robot are shown below:

## The following videos show robot control using teloep_twist_keyboard
The robot is equipped with Lidar (for SLAM) and Camera ( for object tracking algorithm implementations)
